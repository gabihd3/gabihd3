Hey there! 👀

I'm [Gabriel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrieldiaz3/), I have recently graduated in **Physics** and I am based in Manchester, UK.  Genuinely amazed by Deep Learning and self-taught *(potential)* data analyst.

Aiming to eventually contribute to solving physics problems by managing data. 📈📉


## **Ph|𝛹⟩sics** ⚛︎
---
I am experienced in solving physics problems using Python and analysing experimental data. Among the studied methodologies:
* Numerical integration <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\int">

* Fast Fourier Transform <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathcal{F}">
* Solution to non-linear ODE's  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\partial x">


 ## **Analytics 💻📊**

 I am working on my data modelling skills and implementation of statiscal algorithms and Deep Learning. I have experience in:
 * Data preprocessing
 * Regression, Classification and Clustering Algorithms
 * Data visualization
 * Neural Networks
  
I keep improving by using the platform *Kaggle*, aspiring to eventually become a notebook's expert.
